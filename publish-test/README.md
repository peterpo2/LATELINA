This folder previously held published backend artifacts. The AIPharm-branded binaries were removed during the Latelina rename.
Regenerate a fresh publish output with `dotnet publish LATELINA.Backend/LATELINA.Web/Latelina.Web.csproj -c Release -o publish-test /p:UseAppHost=false` once the .NET SDK is available in your environment.
